<h1>Welcome to the Vulnerable Web Application Demo</h1>

<p>This application has been intentionally designed with several security vulnerabilities for educational purposes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> Try the login form with malicious SQL input</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> Post malicious JavaScript in the comments section</li>
    <li><strong>Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):</strong> Access user profiles by manipulating the URL</li>
    <li><strong>Path Traversal:</strong> Upload files to unauthorized locations using the file upload feature</li>
    <li><strong>Command Injection:</strong> Execute arbitrary system commands in the Admin Tools section</li>
    <li><strong>Hidden Flag:</strong> Find and access the hidden flag file in the restricted directory</li>
    <li><strong>Security Misconfiguration:</strong> The application is running in debug mode</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exploitation Scenario</h2>
<p>This application simulates several attack vectors:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use SQL injection to gain access to an account</li>
    <li>Upload a reverse shell script through the file upload vulnerability</li>
    <li>Use command injection to execute system commands or establish a reverse shell</li>
    <li>Find and access the flag hidden in the restricted directory</li>
</ol>
